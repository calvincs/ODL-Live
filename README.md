#### Shout Outs
 - Alex Cobb for sponsoring this code project! See his videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg5GzcNQp5C6STqLP9vNAow/featured)
 - [@WietseWind](https://twitter.com/WietseWind) for his contributions to the XRP community and the [rippled-ws-client](https://github.com/WietseWind/rippled-ws-client) he wrote.  I rolled my own, but switched as his offered more bells and whistles, so thanks!
 - [Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), without you I wouldn't be near as productive :-)
